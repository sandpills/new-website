A time-based performance with a projected live video feed, processed and overlayed in real time. Writing and drawing on each other’s hands with melting ice, Jingyao and I speak in circles about irreversable time, traces, memories, and regrets, asking questions and not receiving answeres.

Playing with glitches in both the video processing effects, and real errors produced from live audio captioning (a Google technology), we draw correlation between computer glitches and our own immigration experiences, often being rendered as flaws in a conventionality, living in a constant stage of flux -- the result of improper data being coded properly (Manon & Temkin, Notes on Glitch, 2011).

“Nothing's going to melt. Everything in it’s right place.”

This project was created in collaboration with Jingyao Shao, a vision emerged out of shared anxiety and performed with love.

This embodied audio-visual performance project was created in collaboration with Sylvia Ke.

Two humans, one computer: Sylvia hums, breathes, and destroys their computer slowly, while directing Viola’s body, an embodied machine, move within the space. Their images and sounds were captured, manipulated and amplified in real time, and projected onto the wall as backdrop. Playing with both audio and visual feedback, Sylvia and Viola create a frantic, erotic digital love story, investigating in the fragile intimacy of human/machine relationship.

Performed May 2023 at Persona, Brooklyn, as a part of [human.machine.interface](https://alpha.persona.nyc/purchase/humanmachineinterface-6362d222), curated by Easterner and Livecode.NYC

Master’s Thesis at NYU

How About Talking to Neighbors is a series of hardware research, theory development, and DIY electronics design projects, in search of surveillance protection by using small technologies within small networks. As our digital spaces become highly centralized and surveilled, this project thinks back on physical proximity (“neighborhood”) as a digital communication framework, creating with small-scale wireless protocols that are independent to large infrastructures as a form of radical resistance.

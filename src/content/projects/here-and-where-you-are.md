"Here and Where You Are" is an audio-visual experience that thrusts viewers into a circular digital metropolis that transforms from a childhood TV room into pulsing cityscapes. Many stories, sounds, and sights run parallel - and in those chaotic landscapes we search for someone who matters.

This project was created with support by UFO Terminal Loading... Project, a two-week creator camp where 15 emerging artists were given the unique opportunities to put up a piece of digital work for a 34.5 meters wide, 6.5 meters tall LED surround screen system.

I started working on this project knowing I'd make use of the dynamic spacial property of the circular screen - a never-ending subway train roaming past, chasing digital characters and ghost-like pedastrian across the space. I created a pixelated look with a bayers dithering algorhithm for the entire visual piece, partially for a nostalgic aesthetics, and partially for better handling real-time performance as I was able to render live at half size.

When the performer and the viewers stand in this space, those moving bodies become part of the story too. Drawing inspiration form my own migration between Shanghai and NYC, mundane life sequences started to blend together as I navigate different worlds. The cities don't speak, they hold us in the stories we create.
